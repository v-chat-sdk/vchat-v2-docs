<h1 style="font-size: 3em; text-align: center;">vchat-sdk</h1>
<p>Vchat-sdk is a SaaS (Software as a Service) chat system that offers <code>real-time</code>
    messaging capabilities for web and
    mobile
    applications. It consists of two parts: the server-side and the client-side. The server-side is built using <code>Node.js</code>
    and
    Socket.IO for real-time communication, while MongoDB is used for data storage.</p>
<p>A unique feature of vchat-sdk is its independence from <code>Firebase</code> for data storage. However, it does
    provide the option
    to
    enable push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging <code>(FCM)</code> or <code>OneSignal</code>.</p>
<p>Create a new app or integrate with an existing production app to get started.</p>
<h2 id="about-v_chat_sdk">About V_CHAT_SDK</h2>
<ul>
    <li>V_CHAT_SDK is a package written in pure Dart and NestJS for the server-side. It helps you add chat functionality
        to
        any existing or new Flutter mobile project, regardless of the back-end service you use.
    </li>
    <li>V_CHAT_SDK offers unlimited text, image, video, record, location, push notifications, and data control.</li>
    <li>With only 6 public APIs, V_CHAT_SDK is an easy way to integrate advanced real-time messaging into your chat.
    </li>
    <li>V_CHAT_SDK uses Node.js for its backend service and Firebase for push notifications. MongoDB is used as the
        message
        database, while the client-side is powered by <code>Flutter</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-microservices">About Microservices</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Reduced load on your main server, as chat traffic can be high.</li>
    <li>Improved scalability: Microservices make it easier to identify and resolve scaling bottlenecks at a
        per-microservice
        level.
    </li>
    <li>Easy to build and maintain: Their single-purpose design enables smaller, cross-functional teams to specialize in
        a
        subset of the microservices within a solution.
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Perfect for social media apps that require a chat system similar to <code>WhatsApp</code> or
        <code>Facebook</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Ideal for e-commerce apps looking to add chat features, such as delivery or marketplace communication, like
        <code>OLX</code> or
        <code>Facebook Marketplace</code>.
    </li>
    <li>Can be used for real-time user chat <code>support</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-v_chat_sdk-works">How V_CHAT_SDK Works</h2>
<p><code>V_CHAT_SDK</code> connects with your backend service, regardless of the language or framework it uses. It
    communicates with
    your system through public APIs and runs separately, yet remains connected via these APIs.</p>
<p>When you register a new user in your system, call the <code>V_CHAT_SDK</code> public API to create a separate
    database for saving
    user information like names, images, and identifiers. Once the user is successfully connected in your client app (
    typically after successful authentication), you need to connect the user to the <code>V_CHAT_SDK</code> system to
    enable
    communication with other users this done through using of flutter packages already build. If you have an existing
    production app and wish to integrate <code>V_CHAT_SDK</code>, you can
    migrate
    old users, as explained in the backend section.</p>

<h2 id="server-requirements-for-v_chat_sdk">Server Requirements for V_CHAT_SDK</h2>
<p>V_CHAT_SDK is a lightweight SaaS chat system with minimal server resource requirements:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 CPU core</li>
    <li>1 GB RAM</li>
    <li>Fast SSD storage</li>
    <li>Ubuntu version 18 or higher</li>
    <li>Recommended hosting: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a></li>
    <li>Domain name: recommended provider is <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">NameCheap</a></li>
